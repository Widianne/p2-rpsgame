## **Planning stage**
I instantly knew I wanted to go for a dark mood when creating the site. And compared to my first project, this is actually pretty much spot on to my original design idea. I started off by making sure to include all the necessary HTML, added in some basic CSS to see my changes and divide the screen accordingly. Lastly, I did the JS and made sure it worked, and then worked on aesthetic details and responsiveness
### **Target Audiences:**
Goths, gals, nbs and nerdy spooky millennial witches (born between 1981 and 1996)
Fans of the dark and retro game vibes
​
### **User Stories:**

​
* As a user, I want to play a fun easy game to relax
* As a user, I want instant response.
* As a user, I want to play this game on severl devices 

​
### **Site Aims:**
​
A site for the gothic rock paper scissor fans to relax and play
​
​
### **Wireframes:**
​
None, the page looks exactly like I wanted it to
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
I started by searching for the right images that matched my gothic vision and took inspiration from my findings. It was important for me to create a site with high-contrasting aesthetics that work well together, providing a visually unique experience, given that the overall site is simple and just a game. My inspiration stemmed from my gothic side, Halloween, and my unusual affinity for old scissors (a wild thing to like, I know) and crystals. Additionally, my profound love for vintage and retro things played a significant role. I mainly wanted the colors to be minimal but have a good moody and poppy feel. Hence, the combination of black and deep blue contrasting with bone white and baby blue, giving the exact spooky-cute vibe I was aiming for

#-colors:
black: 	#000000
deep blue: #000f25
baby blue: 	#5bb5ff
bone white: #f9f9f9

​
## **Typography**
​
Found this cute retro squere font that I just had to have! DotGothic16 <3
Decided to only go for one to keep it simple and let the retro design be represented by the font.
​
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**

Only one page, reset button to restart the game at any time, score counter, and representative imagery collaborating with button choices.
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*
None, one page game
​
​
#### *features
* Header with game/site name and scores
* Buttons for choices
* Imagery representing the match
* Popup for instant response for the user
* Reset button for restarting the game at any time
* Once computer or player reaches 10, game restarts
* Start/reset image is represented by hands
* All these choices provide a fun and engaging game with clear communication

​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
* As I am new to JS and it was honestly so hard to work with, I focused on making the JS basic and functional, and that took time.
* As future improvements, it would be fun to add a rules page.
* Perhaps make a community of sorts, sort of like Wordfeud, where you can play with either your friends or strangers across the world.
* The possibility to change the imagery to match the user's personal goth vibe.
* Would also be fun to create a rigged version where the computer always wins.
​
## **Testing Phase**

* Responsiveness - I had the page up consatly in google chrome and changed to diffrant screans to make sure it all worked 
​
* Functionality - Took a lot o errors before I got it all to work. At first it was only the reset button working but I did get evertyhing to work in the end
​
* Validators - All good in the validators!
​
​
## **Bugs**
​
* Tons of JS bugs, like for a long time I had all the code written, but it didn't want to connect, so it took a lot of time to actually understand and connect everything right.
* I'd love for the imagery to be a little bigger on the smallest screen, but in the end, it works, and the aesthetics became second nature.
​
***
## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -
​
1. From the project's [repository](pageurl), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.

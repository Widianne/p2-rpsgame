## **Planning stage**
I instantly knew I wanted to go for a dark mood when creating the site. And compared to my first project, this is actually pretty much spot on to my original design idea. I started off by making sure to include all the necessary HTML, added in some basic CSS to see my changes and divide the screen accordingly. Lastly, I did the JS and made sure it worked, and then worked on aesthetic details and responsiveness
### **Target Audiences:**
Goths, gals, nbs and nerdy spooky millennial witches (born between 1981 and 1996)
Fans of the dark and retro game vibes
​
### **User Stories:**

​
* As a user, I want to play a fun easy game to relax
* As a user, I want instant response.
* As a user, I want to play this game on severl devices 

​
### **Site Aims:**
​
A site for the gothic rock paper scissor fans to relax and play
​
​
### **Wireframes:**
​
None, the page looks exactly like I wanted it to
​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
I started by searching for the right images that matched my gothic vision and took inspiration from my findings. It was important for me to create a site with high-contrasting aesthetics that work well together, providing a visually unique experience, given that the overall site is simple and just a game. My inspiration stemmed from my gothic side, Halloween, and my unusual affinity for old scissors (a wild thing to like, I know) and crystals. Additionally, my profound love for vintage and retro things played a significant role. I mainly wanted the colors to be minimal but have a good moody and poppy feel. Hence, the combination of black and deep blue contrasting with bone white and baby blue, giving the exact spooky-cute vibe I was aiming for

#-colors:
black: 	#000000
deep blue: #000f25
baby blue: 	#5bb5ff
bone white: #f9f9f9

​
## **Typography**
​
Found this cute retro squere font that I just had to have! DotGothic16 <3
Decided to only go for one to keep it simple and let the retro design be represented by the font.
​
​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**

Only one page, reset button to restart the game at any time, score counter, and representative imagery collaborating with button choices.
​
#### *Navigation Bar:*
None, one page game
​
​
#### *features
* Header with game/site name and scores
* Buttons for choices
* Imagery representing the match
* Popup for instant response for the user
* Reset button for restarting the game at any time
* Once computer or player reaches 10, game restarts
* Start/reset image is represented by hands
* All these choices provide a fun and engaging game with clear communication

​
## **Future-Enhancements**
​
* As I am new to JS and it was honestly so hard to work with, I focused on making the JS basic and functional, and that took time.
* As future improvements, it would be fun to add a rules page.
* Perhaps make a community of sorts, sort of like Wordfeud, where you can play with either your friends or strangers across the world.
* The possibility to change the imagery to match the user's personal goth vibe.
* Would also be fun to create a rigged version where the computer always wins.
​
## **Testing Phase**
​
This is the hardest bit of the readme, when we have completed a page we need to discuss testing.
​
Here is a good idea to talk about how and why you have tested with certain tools and validators so here a list of things to talk through
​
* Responsiveness - How do you test this, dev tools? checking on multiple devices?
​
* Functionality - Each feature needs to be tested before something is complete, talk about the process, click each link check each image, does form validation work, if your using javascript or anything else, does it always behave as the user expects
​
* Validators - Here include images from w3c html validator and css jigsaw (jshint for js and pep8 for python) and the results that came from it
​
​
## **Bugs**
​
We always have bugs in development, a few bullet points here to talk about bugs you found and how you fixed them, in later projects this will be more detailed
​
* Issue - When on mobile the user had horizontal scroll with items overflowing
* Cause - The images had absolute positioning and caused them to go off screen
* Resolution - Changed the width of the image to stay within the confines of the screen.

## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -
​
1. From the project's [repository](pageurl), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
